<h1>Job Platform</h1>

This platform, which I developed to facilitate and accelerate the job search and finding process and to help you organize your job applications, draws attention with its user-friendly interface and rich features. This platform allows you to see new job postings and manage and filter them. You can easily add new job postings and enter all the details. You can view all added jobs and filter them by their status (interview process, ongoing, rejected) and work type (part-time, full-time, intern). You are optimized for a seamless experience on any device.
